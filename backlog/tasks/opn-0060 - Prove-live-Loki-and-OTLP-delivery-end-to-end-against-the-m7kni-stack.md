## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Eight shipped log sources have never been exercised against a real backend. Waves 1 to 3 landed configchange, configstate, device inventory, security posture, routing changes, unparsed-syslog, DNS-domain enrichment and exporter self-logs, and every one of those closed with "live Loki delivery was not run" recorded as not proven. Unit tests pin the record construction; nothing has yet proved a record leaves the process, authenticates, and arrives with the labels and structured metadata the dashboards and annotations query by.

The gap is a class, not a task: the same OTLP export path carries all of them, so one proof run covers all eight, and a single wrong resource attribute or promoted-label assumption would be invisible in unit tests and fatal in a dashboard.

Target is the m7kni stack, owner decision 2026-09-03. The OTLP gateway is `https://otlp-gateway-prod-gb-south-1.grafana.net/otlp` authenticating as the stack id, and Loki is `https://logs-prod-035.grafana.net` with its own tenant id. The gateway speaks OTLP only; the two id spaces do not cross, and a Loki tenant id will 401 at the gateway.

The proof runs locally against the testbed rather than in CI, and the evidence is recorded on this task and on each covered task.

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 Each of the eight sources is observed arriving in the m7kni stack, identified by its opnsense.source value, with the query used and a redacted result recorded
- [ ] #2 The promoted stream-label set observed in Loki matches the documented table in docs/log-shipping.md, and any divergence is written up rather than silently accepted
- [ ] #3 OPN-0038 domain enrichment is confirmed present as structured metadata and confirmed ABSENT from the stream-label set, per its frozen contract
- [ ] #4 Config revision and config snapshot bodies are confirmed redacted in the delivered record, not merely in the unit test
- [ ] #5 No credential value appears in any commit, tracker entry, log or report; the run is identifiable by its instance label so the data can be pruned
<!-- AC:END -->

## Definition of Done
<!-- DOD:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 just check
- [ ] #2 just gen (if any generated artifact changed) and the diff committed
<!-- DOD:END -->
